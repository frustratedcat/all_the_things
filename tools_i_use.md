# Tools I Use

## This list is an attempt to show the technology I use often. I try to be minimal with the technology that I use as I prefer to avoid screens as much as possible, which is quite difficult in the digital age. 

### Operating Systems
- Linux Mint
    - I run mint on a Framework 12 laptop, which I absolutely don't recommend. Avoid Framework, they're a horrible value
- Debian
    - I run Debian on:
        - My parent's old desktop computer from the stone ages
        - WSL2 on my Windows 10 computer
        - WSL2 on my Windows 11 work computer
- Arch
    - I run arch on my old HP laptop from grdauate school
- Ubuntu
    - I run Ubuntu on my Surface Pro 7. I think the dev project behind this build is called Surface Linux
- Windows 10
    - I run Windows 10 on my gaming laptop, an Asus G14 with a RTX 3060
- Windows 11
    - I run Windows 11 on my Dell work computer

### Coding Stuff
- Neovim
    - Check out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/frustratedcat/dotfiles/tree/main/nvim) repo for my neovim config
